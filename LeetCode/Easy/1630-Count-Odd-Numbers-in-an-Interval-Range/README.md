## Description

Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).



 


Example 1:




Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

Example 2:




Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].

 


Constraints:




	0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

## Hints

1. If the range (high - low + 1) is even, the number of even and odd numbers in this range will be the same.
2. If the range (high - low + 1) is odd, the solution will depend on the parity of high and low.
