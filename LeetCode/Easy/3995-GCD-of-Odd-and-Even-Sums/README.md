## Description

You are given an integer n. Your task is to compute the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two values:

	
	sumOdd: the sum of the smallest n positive odd numbers.

	
	
	sumEven: the sum of the smallest n positive even numbers.

	

Return the GCD of sumOdd and sumEven.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4

Output: 4

Explanation:

	Sum of the first 4 odd numbers sumOdd = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
	Sum of the first 4 even numbers sumEven = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20

Hence, GCD(sumOdd, sumEven) = GCD(16, 20) = 4.

Example 2:

Input: n = 5

Output: 5

Explanation:

	Sum of the first 5 odd numbers sumOdd = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25
	Sum of the first 5 even numbers sumEven = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30

Hence, GCD(sumOdd, sumEven) = GCD(25, 30) = 5.

 

Constraints:

	1 <= n <= 10​​​​​​​00

## Hints

1. The first n odd numbers sum to n * n
2. First n even numbers sum to n * (n + 1)
3. gcd(n, n + 1) = 1, so the answer is n
