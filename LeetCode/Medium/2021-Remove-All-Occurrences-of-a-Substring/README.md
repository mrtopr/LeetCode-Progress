## Description

Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

	Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.

Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = &quot;daabcbaabcbc&quot;, part = &quot;abc&quot;
Output: &quot;dab&quot;
Explanation: The following operations are done:
- s = &quot;daabcbaabcbc&quot;, remove &quot;abc&quot; starting at index 2, so s = &quot;dabaabcbc&quot;.
- s = &quot;dabaabcbc&quot;, remove &quot;abc&quot; starting at index 4, so s = &quot;dababc&quot;.
- s = &quot;dababc&quot;, remove &quot;abc&quot; starting at index 3, so s = &quot;dab&quot;.
Now s has no occurrences of &quot;abc&quot;.

Example 2:

Input: s = &quot;axxxxyyyyb&quot;, part = &quot;xy&quot;
Output: &quot;ab&quot;
Explanation: The following operations are done:
- s = &quot;axxxxyyyyb&quot;, remove &quot;xy&quot; starting at index 4 so s = &quot;axxxyyyb&quot;.
- s = &quot;axxxyyyb&quot;, remove &quot;xy&quot; starting at index 3 so s = &quot;axxyyb&quot;.
- s = &quot;axxyyb&quot;, remove &quot;xy&quot; starting at index 2 so s = &quot;axyb&quot;.
- s = &quot;axyb&quot;, remove &quot;xy&quot; starting at index 1 so s = &quot;ab&quot;.
Now s has no occurrences of &quot;xy&quot;.

 

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	1 <= part.length <= 1000
	s​​​​​​ and part consists of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

1. Note that a new occurrence of pattern can appear if you remove an old one, For example, s = "ababcc" and pattern = "abc".
2. You can maintain a stack of characters and if the last character of the pattern size in the stack match the pattern remove them
