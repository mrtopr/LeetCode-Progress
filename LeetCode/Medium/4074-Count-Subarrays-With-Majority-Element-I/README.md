## Description

You are given an integer array nums and an integer target.

Return the number of subarrays of nums in which target is the majority element.

The majority element of a subarray is the element that appears strictly more than half of the times in that subarray.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3], target = 2

Output: 5

Explanation:

Valid subarrays with target = 2 as the majority element:

	nums[1..1] = [2]
	nums[2..2] = [2]
	nums[1..2] = [2,2]
	nums[0..2] = [1,2,2]
	nums[1..3] = [2,2,3]

So there are 5 such subarrays.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1], target = 1

Output: 10

Explanation: 

​​​​​​​All 10 subarrays have 1 as the majority element.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4

Output: 0

Explanation:

target = 4 does not appear in nums at all. Therefore, there cannot be any subarray where 4 is the majority element. Hence the answer is 0.

 

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 1000
	1 <= nums[i] <= 10​​​​​​​9
	1 <= target <= 109

## Hints

1. Use brute force
2. Count all subarrays where 2 * count(target) > length
