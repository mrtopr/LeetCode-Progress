# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Acceptance Rate:** 7714.4%

**Topics:** Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree

[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

## Description

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3

 

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is n.
	1 <= k <= n <= 104
	0 <= Node.val <= 104

 

Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

## Hints

1. Try to utilize the property of a BST.
2. Try in-order traversal. (Credits to @chan13)
3. What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
4. The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
