## Description

You are given two positive integers num and sum.

A positive integer n is good if it satisfies both of the following:

	The number of digits in n is exactly num.
	The sum of digits in n is exactly sum.

The score of a good integer n is the sum of the squares of digits in n.

Return a string denoting the good integer n that achieves the maximum score. If there are multiple possible integers, return the maximum ​​​​​​​one. If no such integer exists, return an empty string.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 2, sum = 3

Output: &quot;30&quot;

Explanation:

There are 3 good integers: 12, 21, and 30.

	The score of 12 is 12 + 22 = 5.
	The score of 21 is 22 + 12 = 5.
	The score of 30 is 32 + 02 = 9.

The maximum score is 9, which is achieved by the good integer 30. Therefore, the answer is &quot;30&quot;.

Example 2:

Input: num = 2, sum = 17

Output: &quot;98&quot;

Explanation:

There are 2 good integers: 89 and 98.

	The score of 89 is 82 + 92 = 145.
	The score of 98 is 92 + 82 = 145.

The maximum score is 145. The maximum good integer that achieves this score is 98. Therefore, the answer is &quot;98&quot;.

Example 3:

Input: num = 1, sum = 10

Output: &quot;&quot;

Explanation:

There are no integers that have exactly 1 digit and whose digits sum to 10. Therefore, the answer is &quot;&quot;.

 

Constraints:

	1 <= num <= 2 * 105
	1 <= sum <= 2 * 106

## Hints

1. Use a greedy approach.
2. Fill the leftmost digits with 9s first (as much as possible).
