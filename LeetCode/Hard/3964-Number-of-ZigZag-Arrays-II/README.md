## Description

You are given three integers n, l, and r.

A ZigZag array of length n is defined as follows:

	Each element lies in the range [l, r].
	No two adjacent elements are equal.
	No three consecutive elements form a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence.

Return the total number of valid ZigZag arrays.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A sequence is said to be strictly increasing if each element is strictly greater than its previous one (if exists).

A sequence is said to be strictly decreasing if each element is strictly smaller than its previous one (if exists).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, l = 4, r = 5

Output: 2

Explanation:

There are only 2 valid ZigZag arrays of length n = 3 using values in the range [4, 5]:

	[4, 5, 4]
	[5, 4, 5]

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, l = 1, r = 3

Output: 10

Explanation:

​​​​​​​There are 10 valid ZigZag arrays of length n = 3 using values in the range [1, 3]:

	[1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 1], [1, 3, 2]
	[2, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [2, 3, 2]
	[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 3], [3, 2, 3]

All arrays meet the ZigZag conditions.

 

Constraints:

	3 <= n <= 109
	1 <= l < r <= 75​​​​​​​

## Hints

1. Use matrix exponentiation
2. Encode states in a vector of length 2*m where m = r - l + 1: first m entries = "next compare = down" for values, next m = "next compare = up".
3. Build a transition matrix T (size 2*m × 2*m): from an up,x state go to down,y for every y > x, and from down,x go to up,y for every y .
4. Use fast matrix exponentiation to compute T^(n-1), apply it to the initial vector (ones in the block for starting up and separately for starting down), sum final entries, and add both results (for n=1 return m).
